Hypertension is a chronic condition when blood pressure is too high. This condition can lead to hardened arteries (blood vessels), decreasing the blood and oxygen flow to the heart. Raised blood pressure can cause chest pain (angina) and heart attack (when blood supply to the heart is blocked). Additionally, high blood pressure also causes brain damage (stroke) and kidney failure. High blood pressure can be diagnosed with the help of a blood pressure monitor. Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure.  Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected.Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): It is the enlargement of the prostate gland. It is a non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland caused due to overproduction of dihydrotestosterone hormone in men. After age 50, most men develop an enlarged prostate gland putting pressure on the urinary bladder. It leads to restricted or obstructed urine flow, the urge to urinate frequently (especially at night), and the feeling of not emptying the urinary bladder.  Raynaud's disease: Also known as cold finger syndrome it causes smaller arteries that supply blood flow to the skin to narrow in response to cold or stress. The affected body parts, especially fingers and toes, might turn white or blue with a cold feeling and numbness until circulation improves, usually when you get warm. \"\n\n\nAlternatives :- \n[\n
